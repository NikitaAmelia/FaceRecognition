🐾 Animal Spirit Face Recognition

Animal Spirit Face Recognition is a Python and OpenCV-based face detection application that uses a webcam to detect faces in real-time and display a randomly generated “Animal Spirit” label above the user's face.

The Animal Spirit label automatically changes every 3 seconds, creating a fun, lightweight, and interactive experience.

📌 Project Description

This project utilizes OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier to detect human faces through a webcam feed.

Each detected face is annotated with a randomly selected Animal Spirit label from a predefined list.

This application is suitable for:

Learning basic Computer Vision concepts

Experimenting with Face Detection

AI-based entertainment projects

Interactive application prototypes

✨ Key Features

✅ Real-time face detection using webcam

✅ Haar Cascade Classifier implementation

✅ Displays Animal Spirit label above detected faces

✅ Animal Spirit changes every 3 seconds

✅ Bounding box visualization on detected faces

✅ Exit application by pressing Q

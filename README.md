# 🐾 Animal Spirit Face Recognition

Animal Spirit Face Recognition is a Python and OpenCV-based face detection application that uses a webcam to detect faces in real-time and display a randomly generated “Animal Spirit” label above the user's face.

The Animal Spirit automatically changes every 3 seconds, creating a fun and interactive experience.

## 📌 Project Description

This project utilizes OpenCV’s Haar Cascade Classifier to detect human faces from a live camera feed.

Each detected face is annotated with a randomly selected Animal Spirit from a predefined list.

### This project is suitable for:
- Learning basic Computer Vision concepts
- Exploring real-time face detection
- Building AI-based entertainment projects
- Creating interactive prototypes
